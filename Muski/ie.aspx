	<h1>No Internet Explorer, please.</h1>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Maybe you've heard it before, or maybe you've been face-to-face with this enemy yourself. 
			Internet Explorer (IE) is often a web designer's worst nightmare, 
			as it is always a little behind the curve, a little quirky, 
			and way too popular to be ignored.

		Despite the fact that this website <em>is indeed</em> developed under Windows,
		we don't use Internet Explorer to test it too, instead, we used Google Chrome
		and Mozilla Firefox. With these standard-adhereing and feature-rich browsers,
		you can really get the most out of not only our website, but also all over the Internet.
		They are the read explorers of the Internet, not Internet Explorer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is a list of alternative browsers that we recommend to use,
		replacing Internet Explorer.
	</p>
	<h2>Free &amp; Open Source software</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Chromium</h3>
			<p>Community product</p>
			<p>Project homepage: <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">www.chromium.org</a></p>
			<p>
				Chromium is what the infamous Google Chrome is built on. It shared almost all
				features and traits of Google Chrome, the commericial product, but it is updated
				a lot faster, and it is fully open-source.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Mozilla Firefox</h3>
			<p>Author: Mozilla Foundation</p>
			<p>Project homepage: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">www.mozilla.org</a></p>
			<p>
				This is what remained of the historic Netscape Navigator. It is now a community
				effort in making it progress.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Other products</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
			<p>Author: Google Inc.</p>
			<p>Product homepage: <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">www.google.com</a></p>
			<p>
				This is the browser we used to test our website. Google Chrome is standard conforming,
				very fast and consuled very little resource. If you are into FOSS, Chromium is what
				it is built upon and is open.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Opera</h3>
			<p>Author: Opera Software ASA</p>
			<p>Product homepage: <a href="http://www.opera.com/">www.opera.com</a></p>
			<p>
				<em>anyone help? i did not use this much.</em>
